## What to show the reviewer (copy-paste into the form or message)
> I implemented a Movie Rental Store database that demonstrates database modeling, referential integrity, and complex SQL queries including JOINs, aggregates, subqueries, and window functions. The SQL script recreates schema, populates sample data, and includes analytical queries I executed to validate business KPIs.
